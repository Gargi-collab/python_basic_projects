3. Stage the changes:
     git add .
   
4. Commit your changes with a clear message:
     git commit -m "Add [project name]: brief description"
   
5. Push your branch to GitHub:
     git push origin my-new-feature
   
6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your changes into main after review.
   
7. Once merged, switch back to main and pull the latest changes:
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
